# auto-update-windows-wallpaper-dimmed
Windows Spotlight is typically updated every 24 hours. However, it is for Lock screen only and there isn't any way to do this for the background wallpaper except through apps in the store. This is a script that fetches whatever Windows Spotlight is being used and updates the background when ran. There is a slight dim for visiblity.
