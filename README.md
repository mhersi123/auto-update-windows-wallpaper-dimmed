# auto-update-windows-wallpaper-dimmed

Made for Windows 10, should be compatible with Windows 11 for the most part.

I create a bat file as well if someone wants to use Task Scheduler to automate this daily. However, I haven't been able to run either ps1 or bat files in a task scheduler yet. If someone does find a way please let me know.

You will also need ImageMagick for windows which is here: https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php

You can also modify the tint on line 23 of the powershell script. Just set the number to a different amount and play around to see what works best.
